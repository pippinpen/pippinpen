### Hi I'm Pip ðŸ‘‹

I'm a creative fullstack developer working with JavaScript and React, Vue, Node and Express.

Combining software engineering with UX/UI chops, I'm a big believer in co-creation, inclusive design and in communication holding the space to be both critical and caring.

I care a lot about accessibility & inclusion, institutional pedagogy and tech for good ðŸŒ±

Skills: JS/React/Vue/Node/Express/SCSS
